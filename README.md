# Task 1 – Basic Arithmetic Operations

This Python program takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

---

## Code

```python
a = input('Enter the first number: ')
b = input('Enter the second number: ')
# These lines prompt the user to enter two numbers.
# input() always returns a string, so we need to convert them to integers.

a = int(a)
b = int(b)
# Converts the string inputs to integers so you can do math with them.

ab1 = (a + b)
print('Addition: ', ab1)
# Adds the two numbers and prints the result.

ab2 = (a - b)
print('Subtraction: ', ab2)
# Subtracts the second number from the first and prints the result.

ab3 = (a * b)
print('Multiplication: ', ab3)
# Multiplies the two numbers and prints the result.

ab4 = (a / b)
print('Division: ', ab4)
# Divides the two numbers and prints the result.
